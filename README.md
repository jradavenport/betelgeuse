# betelgeuse

It looks like Betelgeuse is dipping again. Neat!

Playing with the [AAVSO](https://aavso.org/format-data-file) ~40 year light curve, and adding the new [datapoints from STEREO](http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=13901)

Running a Gaussian Process model using [celerite](https://celerite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with a periodic kernel.

This dip may well be comparable to the big event from last year!
